# AI-POWERED-IMAGE-CLASSIFIER

### **📌 Introduction to Image Classification in Flutter with TFLite**  

Image Classification is a popular **Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML)** application that allows an app to **identify objects in images**. Using **Flutter and TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)**, you can build an **AI-powered mobile app** that classifies images efficiently.  



🔹 How It Works

1️⃣ **User selects an image** from the gallery.  
2️⃣ The app **feeds the image into a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model** (e.g., MobileNet).  
3️⃣ The model **analyzes the image and predicts the object** (e.g., "Dog - 95% confidence").  
4️⃣ The app **displays the results** to the user.  


🔹 Why Use TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) 

✅ **Fast & Efficient:** Optimized for mobile devices.  
✅ **Offline Support:** No internet required.  
✅ **Low Latency:** Runs ML models in real-time.  
✅ **Pre-trained Models Available:** Use MobileNet, EfficientNet, or custom models.
